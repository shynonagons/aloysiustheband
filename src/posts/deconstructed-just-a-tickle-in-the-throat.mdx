# deconstructed: just a tickle in the throat

## part 4 in a track-by-track look at the new AtB record "mortise+tenon"

If I had to make a sweeping "what is this record about" type of statement I might say that MORTISE+TENON[^1] is a record about connections, made and missed; about loves, held and lost; about futures, realized and evaporated. 

The main character in this song is one of those people who seems untouchable, floating above the petty tribulations of the world, but maybe propelled and protected by some short-fuse incandescence that will flame out before its time. 

I think my favorite part of the song is probably the outro, which is a complete vibe switch to this soft piano and ambient-strings thing. Here it is isolated from the rest of the track:
